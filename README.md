## Disclaimer
You shouldn't be using this as it puts a lot of unneccesary load on the wikipedia servers.

If you don't care and still use it, you should [donate to the Wikimedia Foundation](https://donate.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:FundraiserLandingPage&country=SE&uselang=en&utm_medium=spontaneous&utm_source=fr-redir&utm_campaign=spontaneous).

Actually, everybody should be donating to the wikimedia foundation anyway.
